The **Sicilian orange salad** (_Insalata di arance_) is a typical [salad][0] dish of the [Spanish][1] and [Sicilian][2] cuisine, which uses[oranges][3] as its main ingredient. It is usually served at the beginning or at the end of a meal.[\[1\]][4]

In its most basic form the salad consists of thin, tart orange slices served with [olive oil][5], [salt][6] and [black pepper][7]. The slightly tart taste of a salad, which is usually achieved by using a [vinaigrette][8] is instead provided by the orange slices themselves.[\[1\]][4]

Common variations mix the orange slices with a few additional ingredients such as sliced fennel bulbs, onions and black olives.[\[1\]][4] In such cases often a vinaigrette is added as well, which is made of olive oil, white wine [vinegar][9], salt, pepper and various herbs, e.g. [rosemary][10].[\[2\]][11]
